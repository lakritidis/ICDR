# ICDS

**Index Assisted Constrastive Data Synthesis

ICDS is a high performing library for synthesizing contrastive text data. In this context, ICDS builds an inverted index structure and several fast look-up tables with the aim of retrieving similar texts from a corpus. The library is ideal for efficient entity matching, entity resolution, record linkage, and deduplication applications in the NLP realm. ICDS allows for very fast retrieval of similar, positive (i.e. matching), and negative (i.e. non-matching) text samples which can be used either directly, or to fine-tune LLMs and other models.

## Installing ICDS

ICDS can be installed directly by using `pip`:

`pip install icds`

Alternatively, ICDS can be installed from the sources by navigating to the directory where `setup.py` resides:
